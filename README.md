WE can only play it with **alphabets notations** 

there is grids like chess board first you have to select the one of the button which indecates
```
K = King
Q = Queen
R = Rook
B = Bishop
N = Knight (since K is taken by King)
Pawns have no letter; just the square they move to
Use x to indicate a capture e.g. Nxe5 â†’ Knight captures on e5
+ = check
# = checkmate
```

### reseting bot or moves which are not selectable
